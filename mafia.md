# Mafia Party Game Online

Mafia is a social deduction game.
We gather online to play it via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).

The game models a conflict between two groups:

- an informed minority (the mafiosi)
- and an uninformed majority (the citizens)

At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned a role affiliated with one of these teams.

The game has two alternating phases:

- first, a night phase, during which those with night killing powers may covertly kill other players,
- and second, a day phase, in which surviving players debate the identities of players and vote to eliminate a suspect.

The game continues until a faction achieves its win condition; for the city, this usually means eliminating the evil minority, while for the minority this usually means reaching numerical parity with the city and eliminating any rival evil groups.
